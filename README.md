# DeepLabV3
Reimplementation of DeepLabV3

This is an (re-)implementation of [DeepLabv3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05587) in TensorFlow for semantic image segmentation on the [PASCAL VOC dataset](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/). The implementation is based on [DrSleep's implementation](https://github.com/DrSleep/tensorflow-deeplab-resnet) (Many thanks!).
